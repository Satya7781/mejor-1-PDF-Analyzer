# Adobe Hackathon PDF Intelligence - Individual Project

## 👨‍💻 **About This Project**

This project was **created entirely by me (Satya)** as an individual developer for the Adobe Hackathon. 

**This is a personal showcase project** demonstrating my technical capabilities in:
- Full-stack development
- AI/ML implementation  
- PDF processing systems
- Production-ready architecture

## 📖 **For Learning and Reference**

While this is my individual work, you're welcome to:
- **Study the code** for learning purposes
- **Use it as reference** for your own projects
- **Fork it** for your personal learning
- **Understand the architecture** and implementation

**Please note: This represents my individual work and technical expertise.**

## 🚀 Getting Started

- Virtual environment tools

### Development Setup
```bash
# Fork and clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/adobe-hackathon-pdf-intelligence.git
cd adobe-hackathon-pdf-intelligence

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install development dependencies
pip install pytest black flake8 mypy
```

## 🛠️ Development Workflow

### 1. Create a Branch
```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

### 2. Make Changes
- Write clean, documented code
- Follow existing code style
- Add tests for new functionality
- Update documentation as needed

### 3. Test Your Changes
```bash
# Run tests
python -m pytest

# Check code formatting
black .

# Lint code
flake8 .

# Type checking
mypy .

# Test web interface
python web_app.py
```

### 4. Commit and Push
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add your feature description"
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

### 5. Create Pull Request
- Go to GitHub and create a Pull Request
- Describe your changes clearly
- Link any related issues

## 📝 Code Style Guidelines

### Python Code
- Follow PEP 8 style guide
- Use type hints where possible
- Write docstrings for functions and classes
